### PY-STRING-ES1: Laboratory on Strings and List in Python
1. Write a function that counts the NOT vowels in a string;
2. Write a function that given a long string (a text) counts the words in it;
3. Write a function that given a long string (a text) computes the frequencies of the vowels in it;
4. Write a function that given a list returns a string representation of it;
5. Write a function that given a list of numbers gives back the product of all its elements;
6. Write a function that given two lists checks if they have common elements;
7. Write a function that capitalizes all (and only) the vowels in a string;
8. Write a function that given a list returns a list with three lists as elements: one for the numbers,
one for the strings and one for the boolean;
9. Write a function that given a list computes the arithmetic mean of the numbers in it;
10. Write a function that given a list of strings returns the mean length of the strings in it;
11. Write a function that given a list of numbers returns the maximum;
12. Write a function that given a list of numbers returns the minimum;
13. Write a function that given a list of numbers returns the median;
14. Write a function that given a list of numbers returns the quartiles;
15. Write a function that given a integer in decimal returns a list of characters with the single digits
as elements.
16. Write a function that given a string in roman literals returns the decimal value (use only
“additive roman numerals”.
17. Write a function that given two days of a non-leap year counts how many days are in between.
18. Write a function that given two hours of a day in the format of strings like “06.34:15” computes
how many seconds are included in between.
19. Write a function that given a number of seconds returnr the value in days, hours, minutes and
seconds.
20. Write a function that given an integer n and k generates the list of the k-th power of the first n
integers.
